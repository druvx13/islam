## Usage

To view the website locally:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Or serve the directory with any HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:8080

## Note on Transliteration

The IPA transliteration is NOT a pronunciation guide. Rather, it is a mechanical conversion of the Arabic, letter by letter, into equivalent IPA characters. The Arabic text should be treated as primary, and the transliteration as a study aid.

## Typography

This website uses the **Amiri font** (أميري), a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style designed specifically for typesetting the Quran. Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered by Bulaq Press (Amiria Press) in early 20th century Cairo.

The Amiri font is included in the `fonts/` directory and is automatically loaded when you view the website. The font is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](fonts/OFL.txt), making it free to use and distribute.

**Font Features:**
- Classical Naskh calligraphic style
- Optimized for Quranic text with proper diacritical marks
- Excellent balance between traditional beauty and modern readability
- Includes AmiriQuran variant specifically designed for Quranic verses
